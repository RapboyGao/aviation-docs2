:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.18

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

During in-flight restart attempts use the lower of the EGT redline and the
EGT start limit redline. A hung or stalled in-flight start is normally indicated
by @stagnant RPM and increasing EGT@. During start, engines may accelerate
to idle slowly but action should not be taken if @RPM is increasing and EGT is
not near or rapidly approaching the limit@.

###### 8.18

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

- Airframe Vibration Due to Engine Severe Damage or Separation

Certain engine failures, such as fan blade separation can cause high levels of
airframe vibration. Although the airframe vibration may seem severe to the
flight crew, it is extremely unlikely that the vibration will damage the
airplane structure or critical systems. However, the vibration should be
reduced as soon as possible by @reducing airspeed and descending@. In general,
as airspeed decreases vibration levels decrease.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.19

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

When an engine bird strike damages the engine, the most common
indications are @significant vibrations due to fan blade damage and an EGT
increase.@

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.20

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

If large birds or flocks of birds are reported or observed
near the runway, the crew should consider:

- @delaying the takeoff or landing when fuel permits. Advise the ATC and
  wait for airport action before continuing@
- @takeoff or land on another runway that is free of bird activity, if available.@

::::

---

:::: ques

To prevent or reduce the consequences of a bird strike, the crew should:

- @discuss bird strikes during takeoff and approach briefings when operating
  at airports with known or suspected bird activity.@
- @be extremely vigilant if birds are reported on final approach@
- @if birds are expected on final approach, plan additional landing distance to
  account for the possibility of no thrust reverser use if a bird strike occurs.@

Note: The use of weather radar to scare the birds has not been proven
effective.

::::

---

:::: ques

If a bird strike occurs above 80 knots and prior to V1, and there is no
immediate evidence of @engine failure (e.g. failure, fire, power loss, or
surge/stall)@, the preferred option is to continue with the take off followed by
an immediate return, if required.

::::

---

:::: ques

If the landing is assured, continuing the approach to landing is the preferred
option. If more birds are encountered, fly through the bird flock and land.
Maintain @as low a thrust setting as possible@.

::::

---

:::: ques

If engine ingestion is suspected, limit reverse thrust on landing to the amount
needed to stop on the runway. Reverse thrust may increase engine damage,
especially when @engine vibration or high EGT@ is indicated@.

- Discharging Fire Bottles During an Evacuation

:::: ques

if @an engine fire indication exists or a fire is reported in or near an engine@,
discharge a fire bottle into the affected engine

::::

---

:::: ques

the discharged halon agent is designed to extinguish a fire and has very
little or no fire prevention capability in the engine nacelles. Halon
dissipates quickly into the atmosphere

::::

###### 8.22

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

- All Flaps Up Landing

:::: ques

Fly a wide pattern to allow for the increased turning radius required for the
higher maneuver speed. Establish final approximately @10@ NM from the
runway. This allows time to extend the gear and decelerate to the target speed
while in level flight and complete all required checklists. Maintain no slower
than flaps up maneuver speed until @established on final@. Maneuver with
normal bank angles until on final.

::::

---

:::: ques

The normal rate of descent on final is approximately @900@ fpm due to the
higher ground speed. Final approach body attitude is approximately @1° - 2@°
higher than a flaps 30 approach. Do not make a flat approach (shallow glide
path angle) or aim for the threshold of the runway. Use a normal aim point
approximately @1,000@ feet down the runway.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.23

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

- Leading Edge Flaps Transit - Landing

If an asymmetrical or skewed leading edge device condition occurs, use the
LEADING EDGE FLAPS TRANSIT NNC to determine the flap setting and
VREF for approach. VREF provides @15@° bank angle maneuver capability and
allows for 15° overshoot protection in all cases.

###### 8.24

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

A flight control jam in the pitch axis may be difficult to recognize. In the case
of the elevator, the jammed control can be masked by trim. Some indications
of an elevator jam are:

- @unexplained autopilot disengagement @
- @autopilot that cannot be engaged @
- @undershoot or overshoot of an altitude during autopilot level-off @
- @higher than normal control forces required during speed or configuration changes.@

###### 8.26

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

- Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls

  - Approach and Landing

    Establish touchdown attitude no later than @crossing the
    threshold@ and do not reduce thrust to idle until @after touchdown@. Above
    maximum landing weight, some stabilizer trim is needed to assist in the flare
    if the elevator is jammed. @Asymmetrical braking and asymmetrical thrust
    reverser deployment@ may aid directional control on the runway.

::::

---

:::: ques

- Go Around Procedure

If the elevator is known or suspected to be jammed, a go-around should be
@avoided if at all possible@. To execute a go-around with a jammed elevator,
slowly and smoothly advance thrust levers while maintaining pitch control
with stabilizer and any available elevator. If a go-around is required, the
go-around procedure is handled in the same manner as a normal go-around.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.27

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

A runaway stabilizer condition can be recognized by @continuous
uncommanded movement of stabilizer trim, or if stabilizer trim is occurring
in a manner that is not appropriate for current flight conditions.@

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.28

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

It is important to note that even though the steps in the Runaway
Stabilizer checklist are sequential, these steps can be accomplished
simultaneously.

::::

---

:::: ques

In some corner conditions, a low force capable pilot may
need to use two hands, either on one trim wheel handle or one hand on each
trim wheel handle.

::::

---

:::: ques

@Reducing or controlling airspeed@ is the most effective way to
decrease airloads on the stabilizer, which lowers the effort needed to trim
manually

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.31

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The memorized pitch and thrust setting for the current configuration (flaps
extended/flaps up) should be applied immediately with the following
considerations:

- The flaps extended pitch and thrust settings will result in a @climb@.
- The flaps up pitch and thrust settings will result in a slight climb at light
  weights and low altitudes, and a slight descent at heavy weights and high
  altitudes.
- At light weight and low altitude, the true airspeed will be higher than
  normal, but within the flight envelope. At heavy weight and high altitude,
  the same settings will result in airspeed lower than normal cruise but
  within the flight envelope.
- The goal of these pitch and thrust settings is to maintain the airplane
  safely within the flight envelope, not to maintain a specific climb or level
  flight.
- The current flap position should be maintained until the memory pitch
  and thrust settings have been set and the airplane stabilized. If further flap
  extension/flap retraction is required refer to PI-QRH Unreliable Airspeed
  table.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.32

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Possible erroneous flight deck indications that can assist the flight crew to
determine a reliable airspeed indication are:

- @Stick shaker activation on one side @
- @Airspeed low indications on one side @
- @Pitch Limit Indicator (PLI) on one side@

Note: Comparing only two corresponding airspeeds is not a conclusive
indication to determine a reliable airspeed indication. The two
corresponding airspeeds can still both be unreliable.

::::

---

:::: ques

If the flight crew suspects that the unreliable airspeed condition may be
caused by erroneous AOA, in addition to the above flight deck indications,
the AOA DISAGREE alert is shown on both PFDs and erroneous minimum
and maximum speed bars are shown on one side. In this situation, @comparing
indicated airspeed on the PFDs with the ISFD@ can help the flight crew
determine a reliable airspeed indication.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.33

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Takeoff
If an unreliable airspeed event occurs during takeoff at or after V1, maintain
takeoff thrust, set 15° pitch attitude, retract the landing gear, and maintain
flap configuration. Climb at 15° pitch attitude until reaching @acceleration
height@. At @acceleration height@, do the Airspeed Unreliable NNC memory
items and checklist.

::::

---

:::: ques

Idle thrust descents to 10,000 feet can be made by flying pitch attitude and
checking rate of descent in the QRH/PI tables. At @2,000@ feet above the
selected level off altitude, reduce rate of descent to 1,000 FPM.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.34

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

In the event that either the Captain’s or First Officer’s airspeed indication is
reliable, the flight directors on the reliable PFD can be used during an
approach.

When TO/GA is pushed in the event of a go-around or missed
approach, pitch guidance may automatically **be removed from** view on both
PFDs as a result of a disagreement between PFD flight director pitch
guidance. Flight director roll guidance remains available.

::::

---

:::: ques

Flight director pitch guidance returns to view on the reliable PFD when @a
pitch mode change is made or automatically occurs@. Simultaneously, flight
director roll guidance is automatically removed on the unreliable PFD.

::::

---

:::: ques

Note: If only @the standby airspeed indication is reliable@, do not use TO/GA.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.34

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Altitude information transmitted to ATC by the airplane’s transponder may
be unreliable. ATC is **not** an independent source of barometric altitude
information.

::::

---

:::: ques

In the event of an unreliable altitude condition, it is important to note that
GPWS DA/MDA callouts are provided based on the @Captain’s minimum
selector@. If the Captain's altitude indications are not reliable, then the
minimums selector should not be set on the Captain's side, as the DA/MDA
aural callouts are inaccurate.

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The primary purpose of fuel balance limitations on Boeing airplanes is for
the structural life of the airframe and landing gear and not for @controllability@.

::::

---

:::: ques

The primary purpose for fuel balance alerts is to inform the crew that
imbalances beyond the current state may result in @increased trim drag and
higher fuel consumption@.

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

737-600 - 737-900ER

Maintaining a fuel log and @comparing actual fuel burn to the
flight plan fuel burn@ can help the pilot recognize a fuel leak.

::::

---

:::: ques

The Engine Fuel Leak NNC assumes the leak is between @the front spar@ and @the engine@.
This is the most common type of fuel leak since fuel lines are exposed in the strut.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.37

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Some fuel-related checklists (for example, IMBAL) list reasons that a fuel
leak should be suspected. This list is not exhaustive and, in all cases the flight
crew should use their knowledge of the fuel system and current operating
conditions to determine whether a fuel leak should be suspected. Some
reasons are:
•@ The total fuel remaining is less than the planned fuel remaining@. The total
fuel can be less than planned fuel for a number of reasons, such as a fuel
leak, unforecast headwinds, fuel sloshing (such as from high angles of
pitch). Sloshing fuel would be a temporary effect. Flight crews should
consider these when deciding whether or not to suspect a fuel leak.
• @An engine has excessive fuel flow@. A faulty fuel flow meter or an engine
fuel leak downstream of the fuel flow meter will cause an excessive fuel
flow indication. Total fuel remaining compared to planned fuel remaining
should be considered when deciding whether or not to suspect a fuel leak.
• @One main tank is abnormally low compared to the other main tanks and
the expected fuel remaining in the tanks@. One tank indicating abnormally
low can be caused by a fuel leak, engine out or a crossfeed problem. With
an engine out, if the totalizer and calculated values are tracking as
expected, a fuel leak would not be suspected. A fuel pump with higher
pressure and a faulty crossfeed valve can cause one tank to provide fuel
to more than one engine, causing one tank to indicate low. In this case,
the fact that total fuel should still match planned fuel, a fuel leak would
not be suspected.
737-7 - 737-9
• @On PROGRESS page 5/5 the totalizer is less than the calculated fuel@. The
TOTALIZER fuel is the sum of the individual tank quantities. The
CALCULATED fuel is the totalizer value at engine start minus fuel used.
Fuel used is calculated using the engine fuel flow sensors. This can be
caused by a fuel leak or a tank fuel quantity indicator failure. If a tank
fuel quantity indicator has failed, the crew would not suspect a fuel leak.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 8.38

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

If an engine fuel leak is confirmed, the NNC directs the crew to shutdown the affected engine. There are two reasons for the shutdown.
The first is to @close the spar valve, which stops the leak@.
This prevents the loss of fuel which could result in a low fuel state.
The second reason is that @the fire potential is increased@ when fuel is leaking around the
engine.
The risk of fire increases further when the thrust reverser is used
during landing. The thrust reverser significantly changes the flow of air
around the engine which can disperse fuel over a wider area.

::::

---

:::: ques

In a low fuel condition, @the clean configuration@ should be maintained as long
as possible during the descent and approach to conserve fuel. However,
initiate configuration changes early enough to provide a smooth, slow
deceleration to final approach speed to prevent fuel from @running forward@ in
the tanks.

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

- Hydraulic System(s) Inoperative - Landing

Braking action becomes the primary means of directional
control below approximately @60@ knots where the rudder becomes less
effective. If controllability is satisfactory, taxi clear of the runway using
@differential thrust and brakes@. Continued taxi with nose wheel steering
inoperative is not recommended due to airplane control difficulties and heat
buildup in the brakes.

::::

---

:::: ques

- Manual Reversion

A noticeable dead band will be observed in both of
these controls. High control forces are required for turns and the control
wheel must be @deliberately@ returned to the aileron neutral position.

::::

---

:::: ques

- Manual Reversion

Both @electric@ and manual trim are still functional. Do not over trim. The
airplane should be trimmed @slightly nose up@ and a light forward pressure held
on the control column to minimize the effects of the elevator dead band.

:::: ques

- Manual Reversion

Do not make a flat approach.
Anticipate that the airplane tends to pitch down as thrust is reduced for
touchdown.

::::

---

:::: ques

- Manual Reversion

To help reduce the pitch down tendency, trim slightly nose up on
approach and initiate the flare at a @higher@ than normal altitude.

::::

---

:::: ques

- Manual Reversion

Although
trimming during the flare is not normally recommended, the high control
column forces required during landing in this situation can be reduced by
adding a small amount of nose up trim during the flare.

::::

---

:::: ques

- Manual Reversion

After touchdown, thrust reverser operation is slow.
Apply @steady@ brake pressure since only accumulator pressure is available.

###### 8.41

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

- Tire Failure During or After Takeoff

When a tire failure is suspected during takeoff, the landing gear @can@ be
retracted normally. Wheel well design features and automatic wheel braking
prevent damage from a failed tire.

::::

---

:::: ques

If the crew suspects a tire failure during takeoff, the Air Traffic Service
facility serving the departing airport should be advised of the potential for
tire pieces remaining on the runway. The crew should consider continuing to
the destination unless @there is an indication that other damage has occurred@
(non-normal engine indications, engine vibrations, hydraulic system failures
or leaks, etc.).

:::: ques

- Landing on a Flat Tire

Boeing airplanes are designed so that the landing gear and remaining tire(s)
have adequate strength to accommodate @a flat nose gear tire or main gear tire@.

::::

---

:::: ques

When the pilot is aware of a flat tire prior to landing, use normal approach
and flare techniques, avoid landing overweight and use the center of the
runway.

::::

---

:::: ques

Use @differential braking@ as needed for directional control.

With a single tire failure,
@towing@ is not necessary unless unusual vibration is noticed or other failures have occurred.

::::

---

:::: ques

In the case of a **flat nose wheel tire**, slowly and gently lower the nose wheels
to the runway while braking lightly. Runway length permitting, use @idle
reverse thrust@. Autobrakes may be used at the @lower@ settings. Once the nose
gear is down, vibration levels may be affected by increasing or decreasing
control column back pressure. Maintain nose gear contact with the runway.

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Flat **main gear tire(s)** cause a general loss of braking effectiveness and a
yawing moment toward the flat tire with light or no braking and a yawing
moment away from the flat tire if the brakes are applied harder. @Maximum@
use of reverse thrust is recommended. Do not use @autobrakes@.

::::

---

:::: ques

If uncertain whether a nose tire or a main tire has failed, @slowly@ and @gently@
lower the nose wheels to the runway and do not use @autobrakes@. Differential

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

- Partial or Gear Up Landing

  - Landing Runway

  Consideration should be given to landing at the most suitable airport with
  adequate runway and fire fighting capability. Foaming the runway is @not
  necessary. Tests have shown that foaming provides minimal benefit and it
  takes approximately 30 minutes to replenish the fire truck’s foam supply.

::::

---

:::: ques

- Partial or Gear Up Landing

  - Prior to Approach

  At the captain’s command, advise the crew and the passengers of the situation, as needed. Coordinate with all ground emergency facilities.
