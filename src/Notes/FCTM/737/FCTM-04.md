## Climb

### Economy Climb Schedule - FMC Data Unavailable

###### 4.4

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Economy Climb Schedule - FMC Data Unavailable

- @250 knots/VREF 40 + 70 knots, whichever is higher - Below 10,000 feet @
- @280 knots/0.78M - Above 10,000 feet@

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Maximum Rate Climb

###### 4.4

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

A maximum rate climb provides both high climb rates and minimum time to cruise altitude.
Maximum rate climb can be approximated by using the following:

- 737-600 - 737-900ER
  - @flaps up maneuver speed + 50 knots until intercepting 0.76M@
- 737-7 - 737-9
  - @flaps up maneuver speed + 50 knots until intercepting 0.78M@
    Note: The FMC provides maximum rate climb speeds.

:::::::::::::::::::

### Maximum Angle Climb

###### 4.4

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The FMC provides maximum angle climb speeds. Maximum angle climb
speed is normally used for obstacle clearance, minimum crossing altitude or
to reach a specified altitude in a minimum distance. It varies with gross
weight and provides approximately the same climb gradient as @flaps up
maneuver speed@.

::::

## Cruise

### Maximum Altitude

###### 4.6

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The FMC predicted maximum altitude is the lowest of:

- @maximum certified @altitude

  the altitude determined during certification
  considering structural limit (limits on the fuselage), rapid descent
  capability, or other factors determined by the certifying authority

- @thrust limited @altitude

  the altitude at which sufficient thrust is available
  to provide a specific minimum rate of climb. (Reference the Long Range
  Cruise Maximum Operating Altitude table in the PI Chapter, Volume 1 of
  the FCOM). Depending on the thrust rating of the engines, the thrust
  limited altitude may be above or below the maneuver altitude capability

- @ buffet or maneuver limited@ altitude

  the altitude at which a specific maneuver margin exists prior to buffet onset.
  This altitude provides a g margin prior to buffet chosen by airline policy.
  The minimum margin available is 0.3g (40° bank) prior to @buffet@.
  Some regulatory agencies may require a different minimum maneuver margin.

::::

---

:::: ques

For LNAV operation, the FMC provides a real-time bank angle limiting function.
This function protects the commanded bank angle from @exceeding the current available thrust limit@.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 4.7

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

For operations other than LNAV, when operating at or near maximum altitude fly at least @10@ knots above the lower amber band and use bank angles
of @10@° or less.

::::

---

:::: ques

If speed drops below the lower amber band, immediately increase speed by doing one or more of the following:

- @reduce angle of bank@
- @increase thrust up to maximum continuous@
- @descend.@

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Optimum Altitude

###### 4.7

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The optimum (OPT) altitude shown on the CRZ page is determined based on @aircraft gross weight@ and @cruise speed in still air@.

::::

---

:::: ques

When operating in the ECON mode, OPT altitude results in @minimum trip cost@ based on the entered cost index.

::::

---

:::: ques

However, when operation is based on manually entered speed or selected LRC speed, OPT altitude is based on @minimum fuel burn@.

::::

---

:::: ques

OPT altitude calculation does not consider the effects of @temperature@ deviations from standard day or sensed or forecast @winds@ at altitude.

### Step Climb

#### Fuel for Enroute Climb

###### 4.9

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

- 737-600 - 737-900ER

:::: ques

The additional fuel required for a 4,000 foot enroute climb varies
from 300 to 500 lbs (@135 to 225 @kgs) depending on the airplane gross weight, initial
altitude, air temperature, and climb speed.

::::

---

- 737-7 - 737-9

:::: ques

The additional fuel required for a 4,000 foot enroute climb varies from 100 to 200 lbs (@45 to 90@ kgs)
depending on the airplane gross weight, initial altitude,
air temperature, and climb speed. T

::::

---

:::: ques

The fuel saved at higher altitude does not normally justify a step climb
unless the cruise time of the higher altitude is approximately @20 minutes@ or longer.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Low Fuel Temperature

###### 4.9

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The Jet A fuel specification
limits the freezing point to -40°C maximum, while the Jet A-1 limit is @-47@°C
maximum.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 4.10

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The rate of
cooling of the fuel is approximately @3@° C per hour, with a maximum of @12@° C
per hour possible under the most extreme conditions.

::::

---

:::: ques

Total air temperature can be raised in the following three ways, used
individually or in combination:

- @climb or descend to a warmer air mass@
- @deviate to a warmer air mass@
- @increase Mach number.@

::::

---

:::: ques

It takes from @15@ minutes to one hour to stabilize the fuel temperature.
In most cases, the required descent would be @3,000 to 5,000@ feet below optimum altitude.
In more severe cases, descent to altitudes of @25,000 feet to 30,000@ feet might be required.

::::

---

:::: ques

An increase of 0.01 Mach results in an increase of @0.5° to 0.7@° C total air temperature.

:::: ques

Plan the descent to arrive at traffic pattern altitude at flaps up maneuver
speed approximately @12@ miles from the runway when proceeding straight-in
or about @8@ miles from the runway when making an abeam approach. A good
crosscheck is to be at 10,000 feet AGL, 30 miles from the airport, at 250

### Holding Airspeeds Not Available from the FMC

###### 4.24

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Recommended holding speeds can be approximated by using the following
guidance until more accurate speeds are obtained from the FCOM:
• flaps up maneuver speed approximates minimum fuel burn speed and
may be used at low altitudes
• above FL250, use VREF 40 + 100 knots to provide at least a 0.3 g margin
to @initial buffet@ (full maneuver capability).
