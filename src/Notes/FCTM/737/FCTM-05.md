## Approach

### Procedure Turn

###### 5.4

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The FMC constructs the procedure turn path based upon predicted winds, a
@170@ knot airspeed and the “excursion” distance in the nav database for the
procedure.

### Stabilized Approach Recommendations

#### Recommended Elements of a Stabilized Approach

###### 5.5

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

All approaches should be stabilized by 1,000 feet AFE in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and by 500 feet AFE in visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
An approach is considered stabilized when all of the following criteria are met:

-   @the airplane is on the correct flight path@
-   @only small changes in heading and pitch are required to maintain the correct flight path@
-   @the airplane should be at approach speed. Deviations of +10 knots to – 5 knots are acceptable if the airspeed is trending toward approach speed@
-   @the airplane is in the correct landing configuration@
-   @sink rate is no greater than 1,000 fpm; if an approach requires a sink rate greater than 1,000 fpm, a special briefing should be conducted@
-   @thrust setting is appropriate for the airplane configuration@
-   @all briefings and checklists have been conducted.@

::::

---

:::: ques

Specific types of approaches are stabilized if they also fulfill the following:

-   ILS and GLS approaches should be flown within @one dot@ of the glide slope and localizer, or within @the expanded localizer scale@
-   approaches using IAN should be flown within one dot of the glide path and FAC
-   during a circling approach, wings should be level on final when the airplane reaches @300 feet AFE@.

Unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring a deviation
from the above elements of a stabilized approach require a special briefing.

Note: An approach that becomes unstabilized below 1,000 feet AFE in IMC or below 500 feet AFE in VMC requires an immediate go-around.

These conditions should be maintained throughout the rest of the approach for it to be considered a stabilized approach. If the above criteria cannot be established and maintained until approaching the flare, initiate a go-around.

::::

---

:::: ques

At @100 feet HAT@ for all visual approaches,
the airplane should be positioned so
the flight deck is within, and tracking to remain within,
the lateral confines of the runway edges extended.

::::

---

:::: ques

As the airplane crosses the runway threshold it should be:

-   @stabilized on approach airspeed to within + 10 knots until arresting descent rate at flare@
-   @on a stabilized flight path using normal maneuvering@
-   @positioned to make a normal landing in the touchdown zone (the first
    3,000 feet or first third of the runway, whichever is less).
    Initiate a go-around if the above criteria cannot be maintained.@

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Mandatory Missed Approach

###### 5.6

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

On all instrument approaches, where suitable visual reference has not been
established and maintained, execute an immediate missed approach when:

-   ...
-   on ILS or GLS final approach and either the localizer expanded scale
    shows full deflection or the glide slope indicator shows @half or more@
    deflection
-   ...

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Flap Setting for Landing

###### 5.8

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Flaps 30 provides @better noise abatement and reduced flap wear/loads@.
When performance criteria are met, use flaps 40 to @minimize landing speed, and landing distance@.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 5.9

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

At least @adequate@ maneuver margin exists with flaps 15 at VREF 30 + 5 knots or
VREF 40 + 5 knots during a go-around at go-around thrust.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Missed Approach Point

### Determination of a MAP

###### 5.9

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

For approaches such as ILS or GLS, @the DA(H) in conjunction with the glide
slope@ is used to determine the MAP.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## ILS or GLS Approach

### Decision Altitude or Height - DA(H)

###### 5.14

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Cross the procedure turn fix at flaps 5 maneuver airspeed.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Approach

###### 5.15

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

If displaying the arrival procedure is not desired, perform a “DIRECT TO” or
“INTERCEPT COURSE TO” the FAF, OM, or appropriate fix, to simplify
the navigation display. This provides:

-   @a display of distance remaining to the FAF, OM, or appropriate fix@
-   @a depiction of cross track error from the final approach course@
-   @LNAV capability during the missed approach procedure.@

::::

---

:::: ques

When operating in speed intervention (as installed) or an autothrottle SPD mode, timely speed selections minimize thrust lever movement during the approach. This reduces cabin noise levels and increases fuel efficiency. When flaps are extended, select the next lower speed just as @the additional configuration drag takes effect@.

::::

---

:::: ques

APP mode should not be selected until:

-   @the ILS or GLS is tuned and identified@
-   @the airplane is on an inbound intercept heading@
-   @both localizer and glide slope pointers appear on the attitude display in the proper position @
-   @clearance for the approach has been received.@

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

#### Intercepting Glide Slope from Above

###### 5.18

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The following technique will help the crew intercept the G/S safely and
establish stabilized approach criteria by 1,000 feet AFE:

-   @select APP on the MCP and verify that the G/S is armed @
-   @establish final landing configuration and set the MCP altitude no lower than 1,000 feet AFE @
-   @select the V/S mode and set -1000 to -1500 fpm to achieve G/S capture and be stabilized for the approach by 1,000 feet AFE. Use of the VSD (as installed) or the green altitude range arc may assist in establishing the correct rate of descent.@

### Missed Approach - Circling

###### 5.73

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

If a missed approach is required at any time while circling, make a climbing
turn in the shortest direction toward @the landing runway@. This may result in a
turn greater than 180° to intercept the missed approach course. Continue the
turn until established on an intercept heading to the missed approach course
corresponding to the instrument approach procedure just flown. Maintain the
missed approach flap setting until close-in maneuvering is completed
