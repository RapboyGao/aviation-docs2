## Takeoff

### Takeoff Speeds

###### 3.5

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The FCOM and FMC computed takeoff speeds (if enabled) are only valid for dispatch
performance based on @balanced field length, no improved climb, the most
forward CG limit, and dry or wet runway @.

::::

---

:::: ques

The FCOM and FMC computed takeoff speeds do not consider @runway
length available, minimum engine-out climb gradient capability, or obstacle
clearance requirement.@

::::

---

:::: ques

The FCOM and FMC computed takeoff
speeds are not valid for dispatch performance based on @optimized V1
(unbalanced field length), Improved Climb, alternate forward CG limit, or
contaminated or slippery runway@.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Initiating Takeoff Roll

###### 3.6

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

A rolling takeoff is recommended for setting takeoff thrust. It expedites the
takeoff and reduces the risk of foreign object damage or engine surge/stall
due to a tailwind or crosswind.

::::

---

:::: ques

Allow the engines to stabilize momentarily then @promptly@ advance the
thrust levers to takeoff thrust (autothrottle TO/GA).

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 3.7

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The exact initial setting is not as important as setting @symmetrical@ thrust. If thrust is to
be set manually, @smoothly@ advance thrust levers toward takeoff thrust.

::::

---

:::: ques

Allowing the engines to stabilize for more than approximately @2@
seconds before advancing thrust levers to takeoff thrust may adversely
affect takeoff distance.

::::

---

Due to variations in thrust settings, runway conditions, etc., it is not
practical to specify a precise tolerance for N1 deviation between the engines.

---

:::: ques

If an engine exceedance occurs after thrust is set and the decision is made to
continue the takeoff, **do not retard** the thrust lever in an attempt to control the
exceedance.

::::

---

:::: ques

The rudder becomes
effective between @40 and 60 @knots. Maximum nose wheel steering
effectiveness is available when above taxi speeds by using rudder pedal
steering.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 3.8

- June 30, 2022

:::: ques card

A momentary autothrottle overshoot of @4%@ N1
may occur but thrust should stabilize at @+/- 2% N1@, after THR HLD. Thrust
should be adjusted by the PM, if required, to @- 0% + 1%@ target N1.

::::

### Rotation and Liftoff - All Engines

###### 3.9

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

@Above@ 80 knots, relax the forward control column pressure to the neutral
position. For optimum takeoff and initial climb performance, initiate a
smooth continuous rotation at VR toward 15° of pitch attitude.

::::

---

:::: ques

Using the technique above, resultant rotation rates vary from @2° to 3°@ per
second with rates being lowest on longer airplanes. Liftoff attitude is
achieved in approximately @3 to 4@ seconds depending on airplane weight and
thrust setting.

## Crosswind Takeoff

### Rotation and Takeoff

###### 3.19

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Begin the takeoff roll with the control wheel approximately @centered@.
Throughout the takeoff roll, gradually increase control wheel displacement
into the wind only enough to maintain approximately @wings level@.

::::

---

:::: ques

Note: Excessive control wheel displacement during rotation and liftoff
increases spoiler deployment. As spoiler deployment increases, drag
increases and lift is reduced which results in @reduced tail clearance, a
longer takeoff roll, and slower airplane acceleration@.

::::

---

:::: ques

At liftoff, the airplane is in @ a sideslip with crossed controls@. A slow, smooth
recovery from this sideslip is accomplished by slowly neutralizing the
control wheel and rudder pedals after liftoff.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Gusty Wind and Strong Crosswind Conditions

###### 3.19

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

To increase tail clearance during strong crosswind conditions, consider using a
higher VR if takeoff performance permits. This can be done by:

- @increasing VR speed to the performance limited gross weight rotation
  speed, not to exceed actual gross weight VR + 20 knots. Set V speeds for
  the actual gross weight. Rotate at the adjusted (higher) rotation speed.
  This increased rotation speed results in an increased stall margin, and
  meets takeoff performance requirements.@

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Takeoff Field Length - Title 14, CFR

###### 3.25

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The takeoff field length is the longest of the following:

- @the distance required to accelerate with all engines, experience an engine
  failure 1 second prior to V1, continue the takeoff and reach a point 35 feet
  above the runway at V2 speed.@ (Accelerate-Go Distance).
- @the distance required to accelerate with all engines, experience an event 1
  second prior to V1, recognize the event, initiate the stopping maneuver
  and stop within the confines of the runway@ (Accelerate-Stop Distance).
- @1.15 times the all engine takeoff distance required to reach a point 35 feet
  above the runway@.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Rejected Takeoff Decision

###### 3.27

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

If neither pilot recalls the correct rotation speed, rotate the airplane 5 to 10 knots before the displayed V2 speed.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Go/Stop Decision Near V1

###### 3.28

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

As a result, the FAA has changed the definition of V1 in 14 CFR Part 25 to read as follows:

- V1 means the maximum speed in the takeoff at which @the pilot must take
  the first action (e.g., apply brakes, reduce thrust, deploy speedbrakes) to
  stop the airplane@ within the accelerate-stop distance and
- V1 also means the minimum speed in the takeoff, @following a failure of
  an engine at which the pilot can continue the takeoff and achieve the
  required height above the takeoff surface within the takeoff distance@.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Initial Climb - All Engines

###### 3.32

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

V2 + 20 knots is the optimum climb speed with takeoff flaps. It results in @the
maximum altitude gain in the shortest distance from takeoff@.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Minimum Fuel Operation - Takeoff

###### 3.32

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The minimum fuel recommended for takeoff is @trip fuel plus reserves@.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Flap Retraction Schedule

###### 3.35

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

During flap retraction, selection of the next flap position is initiated when
reaching the maneuver speed for the existing flap position. Therefore, when
the new flap position is selected, the airspeed is below the maneuver speed
for that flap position. For this reason, the airspeed should be @increasing@ when
selecting the next flap position.

::::

---

:::: ques

Begin flap retraction at V2 + 15 knots, except for a flaps 1 takeoff. For a flaps 1 takeoff, begin flap retraction when reaching the flaps 1 maneuver speed.

::::

---

:::: ques

When the flaps reach the UP position, verify the flap @lever@ is in the UP detent
and do the After Takeoff checklist.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Takeoff - Engine Failure

### Rotation and Liftoff - One Engine Inoperative

###### 3.37

- June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

With an engine inoperative, a smooth continuous
rotation is also initiated at VR; however, the target pitch attitude is
approximately @2° to 3@° below the normal all engine pitch attitude resulting in
a @12° to 13@° target pitch attitude.

::::

---

:::: ques

The rate of rotation with an engine
inoperative is also slightly slower (1/2° per second less) than that for a
normal takeoff, resulting in a rotation rate of approx @1.5° to 2.5@° per second.

:::: ques

Accomplish the appropriate memory checklist items as soon as @the flight path
