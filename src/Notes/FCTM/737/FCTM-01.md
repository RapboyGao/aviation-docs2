## Flight Deck Philosophy

### Key Elements of Flight Deck Design

###### 1.3

:::: ques card

-   Boeing flight decks are designed to support the priorities of @aviate, navigate,
    communicate and manage airplane systems@.

## Operational Philosophy

### Events Requiring Maintenance Inspection

###### 1.4

-   June 30, 2022

:::: ques card

-   Events Requiring Maintenance Inspection

During ground or flight operations, events may occur which require a maintenance inspection after the flight. Use the following guidance to determine which events require a maintenance inspection:

-   @hard landing@
    -   specify if the landing was hard on the nose gear only, hard on the main gear only or hard on both main and nose gear. Specify if the landing was a hard bounced landing Note: A bounced landing is defined as a landing where both main gears contact the ground and then both main gears leave the ground prior to landing.
        Note: A nose first landing is considered to be a hard nose gear landing.
-   @overweight landing@ - if the overweight landing was not a hard landing the flight crew should record that the landing was not a hard landing
-   @high drag/high side load event@ - one or more of the following conditions occurred:
    -   @airplane ran off the prepared surface@
    -   @airplane landed short of prepared surface@
    -   @two or more tires were blown during landing@
    -   @one or more landing gear hit an obstacle or were hit by an obstacle@
    -   @airplane landed with a large crab or high bank angle resulting in
        abnormally large side-to-side forces as the airplane aligns with the
        runway after touchdown.@
-   @severe turbulence@
-   @overspeed - flap/slat, MMO/VMO, landing gear, landing gear tires@
-   @high-energy stop (refer to the AMM for guidance)@
-   @lightning strike@
-   @extreme dust@
-   @tail strike@
-   @any event that the pilot feels a maintenance inspection could be needed.
    An example of such an event is an overly aggressive pitch up during a TCAS event or a Terrain Avoidance maneuver that could cause structural damage.@
-   @operator-specific procedures or policies may include additional events that require a maintenance inspection.@

    Note: If in doubt, the best course of action is to report it.

## Maneuver Speeds and Margins

### Flap Maneuver Speeds

###### 1.6

-   June 30, 2022

:::: ques card

-   Flap Maneuver Speeds

...
These speeds guarantee @full maneuver capability or at least 40° of bank (25° of bank and 15° overshoot) to stick shaker@ within a few thousand feet of the airport altitude.
...

::::

### Minimum Maneuver Speed

###### 1.7

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

For all flaps-down operations (any time the flaps are not full-up) the
minimum maneuver speed is the slowest speed that provides @full maneuver
capability, 1.3g or 40° of bank (25° of bank and 15° overshoot), to stick
shaker@. The top of the amber band @does not vary@ with g load.

::::

---

:::: ques

As airspeed is decreased below the top of the amber band, maneuver capability decreases. In 1g flight, the speed @in the middle of the amber band@ provides adequate maneuver capability or 30° of bank (15° of bank and 15°overshoot).

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

###### 1.9

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Flap maneuver speeds are based on @airplane weight@, while the minimum maneuver speed is calculated
using @airplane angle of attack@ and @current airspeed@.

::::

---

:::: ques

-   For altitudes up to approximately 10,000 feet, the flaps-up amber band
    functions just like the @flaps-down amber band@ described above, with the top
    of the amber band representing full maneuver capability
-   Due to increasing @Mach effects@ between 10,000 and 20,000 feet, the maneuver capability at the
    top of the amber band decreases as altitude increases, but still provides at least @adequate@ maneuver capability.
-   Above approximately 20,000 feet, the top
    of the amber band shows the speed that provides 1.3g maneuver capability to
    @low speed buffet@ (or an alternative approved maneuver capability as preset by
    maintenance).

### Maneuver Margins to Stick Shaker

###### 1.10

-   June 30, 2022

:::: ques card

-   For a fixed weight and altitude, maneuver margin to stick shaker increases
    when airspeed increases. Other factors may or may not affect maneuver
    margin:

@Gross weight@: generally maneuver margin decreases as gross weight
increases. The base speed (V2 or VREF) increases with increasing weight.
The speed additive is a smaller percent increase for heavier weights

@Altitude@: generally maneuver margin decreases with increasing altitude
for a fixed airspeed

@Temperature@: the affect of a temperature change on maneuver margin is
@negligible@

@Landing gear@: a small decrease in maneuver margin may occur when the
landing gear is extended. This loss is equivalent to@ 2 @knots of airspeed or
less

@Speedbrakes@: maneuver margin decreases at any flap setting when
speedbrakes are extended

@Engine failure during flap retraction@: a small decrease in maneuver
margin occurs due to the reduced lift experienced with the loss of thrust.
The loss is equivalent to@ 4 @knots of airspeed or less

@Anti-ice@: the use of wing anti-ice reduces the flaps-up and flaps-down
maneuver margin. The use of engine anti-ice reduces the flaps-down
maneuver margin but has no affect on the flaps-up maneuver margin. If
only the engine anti-ice is used, the effect goes away when the engine
anti-ice is turned off. If the wing anti-ice is used, the effect remains until
the airplane lands

## Reference Bugs

### Bug Setting (MASI or PFD/ND)

###### 1.17

-   June 30, 2022

:::: ques card

V2 is the minimum takeoff safety speed and provides at least @30@° bank capability
(@15@° + 15° overshoot) for all takeoff flaps. An airspeed bug is automatically
set 15 knots above command speed. V2 + 15 knots provides @40@° bank
capability (@25@° + 15° overshoot) for all takeoff flaps.

::::

## Thrust Management

### Maximum Thrust

###### 1.20

-   June 30, 2022

:::: ques card

The term “maximum thrust” is used in various places in the FCTM and the
FCOM. Maximum thrust is attained:

for airplanes with electronic engine controls (EECs) operating in the
normal mode, by @advancing the thrust levers full forward@

for airplanes with EECs operating in the alternate mode, by advancing the
thrust levers to@ the full rated takeoff or go-around limit @only. Advancing
the thrust levers to the full forward stop should only be considered if
@terrain contact is imminent@.

::::

## Callouts

### Recommended Callouts

###### 1.22

-   June 30, 2022

:::: ques card

If automatic callouts are not available, the PM may call out radio
altitude at @100 feet, 50 feet and 30 feet (or other values as required)@ to
aid in developing an awareness of eye height at touchdown.

::::

## Recommended Rudder Trim Technique

### Drag Factors Due to Trim Technique

###### 1.33

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

-   Drag Factors Due to Trim Technique
    ... These conditions result in increased fuel consumption. Small out of
    trim conditions affect fuel flow by less than @1%@, if no spoilers are deflected.

::::

---

:::: ques

Note: Aileron trim may be required for @significant fuel imbalance, airplane damage, or flight control system malfunctions@.

## Pilot Incapacitation

###### 1.50

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

-   Pilot Incapacitation

Failure of any crewmember to respond to a @second@ request or a checklist response is cause
for investigation.

::::

---

:::: ques

If a pilot is confirmed to be incapacitated, the other pilot should take over the
controls and check the position of essential controls and switches.

-   @after ensuring the airplane is under control, engage the autopilot to reduce
    workload@

-   @declare an emergency@

-   @use the cabin crew (if available). When practical, try to restrain the
    incapacitated pilot and slide the seat to the full-aft position. The shoulder
    harness lock may be used to restrain the incapacitated pilot@

-   @flight deck duties should be organized to prepare for landing@

-   @consider using help from other pilots or crewmembers aboard the
    airplane.@

## Turbulent Air Penetration

###### 1.51

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

Flap extension in an area of known turbulence should be delayed as long as possible because@ the airplane can withstand higher gust loads with the flaps up.@

::::

---

:::: ques

If operating at cruise thrust limits, it may be difficult to maintain cruise speed. If this occurs, @select a higher thrust limit (if available) or descend to a lower altitude.@
