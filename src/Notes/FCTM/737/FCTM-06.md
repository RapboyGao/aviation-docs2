## Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI/T - VASI)

### Precision Approach Path Indicator

###### 6.6

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

When the airplane is on a normal 3° glide path, the pilot sees two white lights
on the left and two red lights on the right. The PAPI may be safely used in
relation to threshold crossing height, but may result in @landing further down
the runway.@ The PAPI is normally aligned to intersect the runway 1,000 to
1,500 feet beyond the threshold.

## Flare and Touchdown

### Bounced Landing Recovery

###### 6.42

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

If the airplane bounces during a landing attempt, @hold or re-establish a
normal landing attitude and add thrust as necessary to control the rate of
descent@.

::::

---

:::: ques

Thrust need not be added for a @shallow bounce or skip@.

::::

---

:::: ques

If a high, hard bounce occurs, @initiate a go-around@.

::::

---

:::: ques

Manually advance thrust levers to go-around thrust, and verify @speedbrakes are retracted@.

::::

---

:::: ques

Do not retract the flaps or landing gear until @a positive rate of climb is established@ because a second touchdown may occur during the go-around.

## Rejected Landing / Balked Landing

### Rejected Landing

###### 6.42

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

A rejected landing is @a discontinued landing attempt and go-around initiated at
low altitude (below DA(H) or MDA(H)) but prior to touchdown. @
If a rejected landing becomes necessary, follow the Go-Around and Missed Approach
procedure as prescribed in the FCOM/QRH.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Balked Landing

###### 6.42

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

A balked landing is a @discontinued landing attempt and go-around initiated at
or after touchdown, but prior to initiation of reverse thrust. @

::::

---

:::: ques

The balked landing technique maintains @landing flap configuration@ to expedite climb
away from the runway environment.

::::

---

:::: ques

Considerations for a balked landing include

-   @clearance of an obstacle in the runway environment,@
-   @insufficient runway for continued landing, or@
-   @transitioning to a go-around from a low-energy state.@

::::

---

:::: ques

When performing a balked landing, disengage the autopilot, disconnect the
autothrottle, smoothly advance thrust levers to go-around thrust, and verify
speedbrakes are retracted. Maintain landing flaps configuration and smoothly
rotate toward 15° pitch attitude at no less than @VREF@. Column forces during
rotation can vary. When @safely airborne with a positive rate of climb@,
continue the Go-Around and Missed Approach procedure as prescribed in the
FCOM/QRH.

## Landing Roll

###### 6.44

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

After main gear touchdown, initiate the landing roll procedure.
Fly the nose wheels smoothly onto the runway @without delay@.
If the speedbrakes do not extend automatically move the speedbrake lever to the UP position without delay.
Control column movement forward of neutral should not be required.
Do not @attempt@ to hold the nose wheels off the runway.
Holding the nose up after touchdown for aerodynamic braking is not an effective braking
technique and results in high nose gear sink rates upon brake application and
reduced braking effectiveness.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Speedbrakes

###### 6.44

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

If the speedbrakes are not raised after touchdown, braking effectiveness may be
reduced initially as much as @60%@, since very little weight is on the wheels
and brake application may cause rapid antiskid modulation.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

### Wheel Brakes

#### Brake Cooling

###### 6.53

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

The optional brake temperature monitoring system may be used for
additional flight crew guidance in assessing brake energy absorption.
This system indicates a stabilized value approximately @fifteen@ minutes after brake
energy absorption.

::::

:::::::::::::::::::

## Overweight Landing

###### 6.63

-   June 30, 2022

::::::::::::::::::: card

:::: ques

During flap extension, airspeed can be reduced by as much as @20@ knots below normal maneuver speeds before extending to the next flap position.
These lower speeds result in larger margins to the flap placards, while still providing normal bank angle maneuver capability, but do not allow for a 15° overshoot margin in all cases.
